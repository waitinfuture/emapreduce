When a cluster is created, several domain names are bound to the cluster by default for you to access your open source components:

-   Yarn
-   HDFS
-   Ganglia

These links can be found in **Quick portal for components** in Cluster management.

By default, there is no username and password for accessing. Therefore, the access request cannot pass the HTTP authentication. You need to click **Access setting** to set an access username and password to access your component UI interface.

Only one username and one password can be used. Therefore, the new username and password will always replace the previous ones.

**Note:** NOTE: Currently, this function is only supported by Version 2.3 and later.
